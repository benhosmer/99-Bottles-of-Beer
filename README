This is an exercise that hopefully others might participate in as well. 

The popular song "Nintey-nine bottles of beer on the wall" iterates from 99 all the way to nothing.

I had the idea of writing this using as many programming languages as possible to see how each would work and how the context would be written.

Please feel free to add your own and to create variations of the ones that are already here.

I've created very simple python and PHP versions.

Have fun!
